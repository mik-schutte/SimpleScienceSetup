## Scematic
TODO: Add a scematic for the layout of the mock setup.

## Instructions
1. For each of the holes in the laser-cut breadboard tap a 6mm wire into it with a 6mm tapping drill.
2. Screw a 6mm hexbolt into each corner of the breadboard.

3. Level the breadboard by adjusting the height of each hexbolt. Use a leveler to track progess.
4. Place the small rodent holder and fasten it using two 6mm hexbolts.
