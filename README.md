# SimpleScienceSetup
Scientific research requires a specific environment that is fine-tuned for each experiment and experimenter. Such an enviroment is referred to as a setup. To achieve the necessary specificity of a setup many parts have to be tried, tested and often replaced. However, the costs of building a setup can quickly rise and ordering/delivery can be time-consumable. Therefore, we have created a set of 3D printable assecoires that can be utilized for building your setup.

This [open-source hardware](https://hackmd.io/k3uEA4e_SAG1fw5R7pmGMQ) project is designed aims to create a starter kit for composing experimental setups. These can in turn be utilized for all kinds of purposes (e.g. education, prototyping, low-cost alternative). If you come up with new ideas for the kit we encurage you to contribute and share them on [our GitHub](https://github.com/open-make).

## Description of components
Some of the components needed to build the SimpleScienceSetup can be 3D printed or laser-cut. We provide files for:
* Breadboard
* Rod-connector at 90 degrees
* Rod-connector at flexible degrees
* Small rodent holder
* Basler camera holder

If necessary you can order any additional components such as optical posts, mounts, rails or enclosures. 

|Component|Description|
|--------|--------|
|Breadboard| A semi-portable base plate to build your setup on. Filled with 6mm mounting holes for attaching your components.|
|Rod-connector [90d]| A one-part connector that allows for the attachment of two rods at a 90-degree angle.|
|Rod-connector flex| A two-part connector that allows for the attachement of two rods at all angles.|
|Small rodent holder| A movement restricting tube that can be mounted to the broadboad.
|Basler camera holder | An attachment for connecting a Basler camera to a rod.|

## State of the Project
The project is in the research phase. As of 21-11-2022 the research involves developing of the 3D printable components. This development process is done in colaboration with the [OpenHardware Academy of the TU Delft](https://www.openhardware.academy/01_Welcome.html). In the future we aim to expand the variety of components. 

## Prototypes
In case you are wondering how each component came to be, we provide detailed design progress. This will take you through the design history and reasoning behind decisions of each accessoire. This information can be found within the folder of each component.

## Alternatives
This project serves as a low-cost alternative to distributors of optic system building blocks such as: Thorlabs and Edmundoptics. However, the higher costs of these distributors are accompanied by more solid and less breakable components.
